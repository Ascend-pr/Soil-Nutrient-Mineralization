**🌱 Soil Nutrient Mineralization Dashboard (Excel)**

**📌 Overview**

This project presents a single-page Excel dashboard designed to analyze soil nutrient mineralization under varying soil textures and amendment treatments during an incubation study.

The dataset is synthetic but agronomically realistic, modeled after standard soil incubation experiments commonly used in soil fertility research.

**🎯 Project Objectives**

1. Analyze nitrate mineralization trends over incubation periods

2. Compare nutrient availability across soil texture classes

3. Evaluate the effect of soil amendments on nitrate and phosphate levels

4. Communicate insights using KPIs and interactive Excel visuals

**🗂 Dataset Description**

The dataset represents a controlled incubation experiment with the following variables:

- Soil Texture

  - Sandy

  - Loamy

  - Clay

- Treatment

  - Control

  - Biochar

  - Fertilizer

  - Biochar + Fertilizer

- Incubation Day

  - 0

  - 14

  - 28

  - 42
 
  - 56

- Measured Parameters

  - Nitrate concentration (mg/kg)

  - Phosphate concentration (mg/kg)

 - Experimental Structure

   - T hree replicates per treatment combination

All variables are stored in one Excel worksheet to enable seamless analysis and dashboard construction.

**🛠 Tools and Methods**

 - Microsoft Excel

 - PivotTables

 - PivotCharts

 - Slicers for interactivity

 - Excel formulas for KPI calculations

 - Dashboard layout and data visualization best practices

**📊 Dashboard Components**
- [x] Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- [x] Peak nitrate concentration (mg/kg)

- [x] Average nitrate concentration (mg/kg)

- [x] Average phosphate concentration (mg/kg)

- [x] Maximum incubation duration (days)

All KPIs update dynamically based on slicer selections.

Visualizations

1. Line chart showing nitrate mineralization over time

2. Clustered column charts comparing:

    - Average nitrate concentration by treatment and soil texture

    - Average phosphate concentration by treatment and soil texture
**
Interactivity**

The dashboard includes slicers for:

 - Soil texture

 - Treatment

 - Incubation day

These slicers allow users to filter and explore nutrient behavior under specific experimental conditions.

**💡 Key Insights**

 1. Fertilizer and biochar–fertilizer treatments produced higher nitrate mineralization over time

 2. Biochar treatments improved phosphate retention, particularly in clay soils

 3. Soil texture significantly influenced nutrient availability and treatment response

 4. Nutrient concentrations generally increased with incubation duration

**🚀 Use Case**
